                    We all must be well aware about the Islamic Golden Age which lasted from about 8th century to 13th century.
                    It made numerous contributions to the field of science and technology, which also paved a way to the cultural and economic
                    development moving towards the flourishment of the Muslims throughout the world. Following are some eminent
                    personalities whose work is till date is considered to be very beneficial in major spheres of science.

                Ibn Sina was a Muslim physicist (also known as Avicenna) who is one of the most influential scientist of all times.
                    His contributions in the field of science are highly commendable. At a really early age Ibn Sina developed a great deal of interest in the field of medicine. 
                    Avicenna’s maximum vital paintings of philosophy and technology is Kitāb al-shifā (The Book of Healing), that is a four-component encyclopaedia overlaying logic,
                    physics, mathematics, and metaphysics. In addition to this, Al Qanun Fi Al-Tibb (The Canon of Medicine) is also immensely popular in the west as it provides a
                    comprehensive detail about the discoveries in the field of medicine. Ibn Sina’s scientific and philosophical legacy scattered for the duration of each of the Islamic
                    countries and Europe in later centuries. In total, Avicenna wrote over 400 works, of which around 240 have survived. The Islamic international used his works each in 
                    scientific education and philosophical investigations. Ibn Sina is customary included as one of the pinnacle of three sages of Islamic Peripatetic philosophy.

                    Abu Rayhan Muhammad Ibn Ahmed Al-Biruni (born in Uzbekistan, 973) was commonly known as “The Father of Astrology” and “First ever Anthropologists”.
                    He made tremendous advancements in the field of geodesy in which he applied the laws of physics to the motion of the planets. With this,
                    he wrote his very first book called Kitab al-Hind, a compilation of India's religion and philosophy. This narrative of his had a specific
                    significance as it provided a vast knowledge about the culture, philosophy, religion, geography and other aspects of India along with Indian astronomy,
                    astrology and the calendar. Furthermore, in physics, he found the radius of the earth to be 6339.6 kilometers, compared the speed of light with that of sound,
                    explained different ratios of the densities of various metals etc. His contributions in mathematics include describing integers, summation series, Archimedes' theorems,
                    algebraic equations, conic section, trigonometry and much more. Kitab al-tafhim (Book about the elements of Art Astrology) is also one of his excellent piece of writing.
                    Due to his efforts we are able to learn and examine various information to such extents which one can imagine.

                    Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a Persian scientist who studied most of the sciences in the city of Bhaghdad. 
                    The Arabic numeral system was introduced to the Western world by Muhammad al-Khwarizmi. 
                    The system was based on ten symbols, as opposed to the Roman numeral system, which employed the I, V, V, L, and C 
                    symbols to denote numbers up to one hundred. Because one sign represented one digit, the Arabic numerals were less bulky.
                    This facilitated the development of higher mathematics and more sophisticated calculations. By inventing a new method for solving 
                    linear and quadratic equations, Muhammad al-Khwarizmi created the concept of algebra. Applied mathematics is the subject of his famous book 
                    Hisâb al-Jabr wa'l-Muqâbalah. Its first section covers the first and second degree equations. The book's second section covers practical
                    mensuration, including rules for calculating the area of various plane figures.

                    Al-Khwarizmi had also made contributions to geography. Claudius Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century CE) has been translated into Arabic multiple times.
                    His geography work, Kitâb Sûrat al-Ard (Book of the Image of the Earth), is almost entirely made up of lists of longitudes and latitudes of localities,
                    with the coordinates of the sites tallied. Dr. S. Razia Jafri, an Indian scholar, has completely recreated al-global Khwarizmi's map, known as al-Sûrat al-Ma'muniyya.
                    It's divided into 38 sections, each of which is further subdivided into 1740 small squares from West to East and 1200 small squares from South to North.

                        Ibn-Al-Haytham was a Muslim Arab scientist and mathematician, born in Persia (now Iraq) and possibly died in Cairo, Egypt. 
                        We won't be able to cover even a small portion of Ibn-Al- Haytham's writings because they are far too extensive. 
                        He is thought to have written roughly 92 works, with around 55 of them surviving. Optics, including a theory of light and a theory of vision, astronomy, and 
                        mathematics, especially geometry and number theory, were among his principal concerns. Kitab al-Manazir, a seven-volume book on optics,
                         is widely regarded as Ibn-Al- Haytham's most important contribution. He observes that light is the same regardless of its source. 
                        He provides the first right explanation of vision, demonstrating that light is reflected off an object and enters the eye. 
                        The remainder of Book I is devoted to the structure of the eye. His research in optics did, however, lead him to propose the use of a 
                        camera "obscura," and he was the first to mention it.
                    </p>

            Ibn al-Haytham was a prolific author. He published 25 works on mathematical sciences, 44 works on (Aristotelian) physics and
            metaphysics, as well as meteorology and psychology. Ibn-Al-Haytham discovered the sum formula for the fourth power by 
            employing a method that could be used to the sum of any integral power. He used it to calculate the volume of a paraboloid. 
            He may have been the first to assert that every even perfect number has the formula 2n-1(2n-1), where 2n-1 is prime.
            Ibn-Al-Haytham attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes in elementary geometry (crescent shapes).
            He devised the Lambert quadrilateral, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld refers to as the "Ibn -Al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral."
