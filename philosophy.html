                <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top : 30px; margin-left: -50px; ">
                    Al Ghazali was a Persian polymath and regarded as one of the most influential philosophers, theologians, jurists and mystics of Islam. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -50px; ">
                    He was born in Taraban, in district of Tus, Khorasan. His father died in poverty and left him along with his brother Ahmad to the care of a Sufi. He began to receive instruction in Fiqh from a local teacher Al Juwayni, a distinguished jurist and theologian in Nishapur. Later he departed and joined the court of Nizam Ul Mulk.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -50px; ">
                    A total of 70 works are attributed to Al Ghazali. His book of the 11th century titled "Incoherence of the Philosophers" marks a major turn in Islamic epistemology and in Islamic philosophy in its vehement rejections of Aristotle and Plato. 
                    He wrote "Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal", an autobiography towards the end of his life. It is considered a work of major importance as in it he recounts how he studied and mastered arguments of Kalam, Islamic philosophy and Ismailism.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -50px; "> 
                Another is "The Revival of Religious Sciences" that covers almost all fields of Islamic sciences. It is divided into four sections that are Rub al-Ibadaat (Acts of Worship), Rub al-Adataat (Norms of daily life), Rub al-Muhlikat (Ways to Perdition) and Rub al-Munjiyat (Ways to Salvation).
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -50px; ">
                    He wrote most of his works in Arabic and a few in Persian. His most important work is Kimyaye Sa'adat, a Persian version of Revival of Religious Sciences that is considered as one of outstanding works of 11th century. 
                    Ghazali was the first to consolidate ideas of Sufism into Sharia laws. He likewisely assumed a noteworthy part in spreading Sufism and Sharia. 
                    His works fortify the position of Sunni Islam, contrasted with different schools of thought.

                        Abu Yusuf Ibn Ishaq Al Kindi originated from Iraq. He was the first of Islamic philosophers and is hailed as "The Father of Arab Philosophy".
                        He was born in Kufa and educated in Baghdad.

                    <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -8px; ">
                        His greatest contribution to Islamic history development was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to Muslim audience.
                        With translating significant texts, much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with him.
                        In his writings, the central concern was to demonstrate compatibility between philosophy and natural theology.

                        He became the first major writer in optics where he developed a theory, "Everything in the world emits rays in every direction which fill the whole world."

                        In chemistry, he denied the possibility of transmuting base metals into precious metals. One work known as Kitab Al-Taraffuq Fitr contains earliest references
                        to distillation porcess for extracting rose oils and provides recipes for 107 different kinds of perfumes.

                    Al Razi was born in city of Ray, located on southern slopes of Alborz mountain range near Tehran, Iran. In youth, he moved to Baghdad and studied and practiced at a local hospital. 
                    He was then later invited back to Ray and became a hospital's head.

                    He contributed in several ways to the early practice of pharmacy by compiling texts, where he introduced use of mercurial ointments and his development of apparatus such as mortars, flasks, spatulas, and phials.
                    He compared the outcome of patients with meningitis treated with blood-letting with that of those treated without it in order to see if blood-letting could actually help.

                    educated doctors did not have answers to all medical problems and could not cure all sicknesses. To become more useful in their services, he advised practitioners to keep up with advanced knowledge by continually studying medical books.

                        Al Farabi was a renowned early Islamic philosopher and jurist who wrote in the fields of political philosophy, metaphysics, ethics and logic.
                        He was also a music theorist and a cosmologist. In Islamic tradition he was called "The Second Teacher" and was credited with preserving original greek texts during the middle ages due to
                        his commentaries and treatises, and influencing many prominent philosophers.

                        He included a number of non-Aristotelian element in his work and discussed the topics of future contingents and relation between logic and grammar.
                        Al Farabi also considered theories of conditional syllogisms and analogical inference, part of logic rather than Aristotelian.

                    <p class="text-dark" style="font-size: 18px; text-align:left; margin-top :-10px; margin-left: -8px; ">
                        In music, he wrote a book titled Kitab Al-Musiqa. In it he presents philosophical principles about music, the cosmic qualities and influences.

                        As a philosopher, he was a founder of his school of early Islamic philosophy known as "Alfarabism". His work aimed at synthesis of philosophy and sufism paved way for the work of Ibn Sina.
                        He also wrote commentary on Aristotle's work. One of the most notable is Al-Madina Al-Fadila, where he theorized an ideal state as in Plato's "The Republic".
                        He argued religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion, along with that ideal state was the city state of Medina when governed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as head of state. He considered democracy as closest to ideal state.
