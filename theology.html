                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                His full name was Abu Al-Hasan ʿAli ibn Ismaʿil ibn Ishaq al-Ashʿari. 
                It is known that Al-Ashʿarī occupied a middle position between the two diametrically opposed schools of theological thought that prevailed at the time. He opposed the mutesils, who supported the extreme use of reason in theological debates and believed that the Qur'an was created, not uncreated. Ashari refuted this by saying that “if the Qur'an was created, then it means that God created this knowledge and therefore did not have knowledge of the Qur'an before it, and this is contrary to God's omnipotence because He knows everything and therefore must always be. they had knowledge of the Qur'an. ”The Zahirites, Mujasimites, and Muhadists also opposed the use of philosophy or kalam and completely condemned any theological debate.
                Maqalat al-Islamiyyin wa Ikhtilfa al-Musallin (“Conversations of Defenders of Islam and Differences Among Devotees”), an encyclopedia of deviant Islamic sects. This includes not only the account of Islamic sects, but also the examination of questions in kalam, or scholastic theology, and the names and attributes of Allah; Most of this work seems to have been completed before his conversion to Mu'tazilt.

                Al-Luma` al-Kabir ("Book of Sparks"), a preface by Idah al-Burhan and, together with Luma` al-Saghir, the last work compiled by al-Ash`ari according to Sheikh Isa al-Burhan Humyari.

                <h2 style="color: #EB5E28;">Abū Mansur Muhammad</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Abu Mansur Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Mahmud as-Samarkandi al-hanafi, often referred to as Abu Mansur al-Maturidi for short, or reverently as Imam Māturīdī by Sunni Muslims, was a Sunni Hanafi jurist, theologian, and scriptural exegete from ninth-century Samarkand who became the eponymous codifier of one of the principal orthodox schools of Sunni theology, the Maturidi school, which became the dominant theological school for Sunni Muslims in Central Asia and later enjoyed a preeminent status as the school of choice for both the Ottoman Empire and the Mughal Empire.
                He was from a place called Maturid in Samarqand (Uzbekistan), and was known as Shaykh al-Islam, and the "Imam of Guidance" (Imam al-Huda). He was one of the two foremost Imams of the Ahl al-Sunnah in his time, along with al-Ash'ari in matters theological.
                Maturidi defined religion (īmān) as taṣdīḳ bi 'l-balb or "inner consent, expressed through verbal confession (ịḳrār bi' l-lisān)". In addition, for Maturidi, Islamic deeds (aʿmāl) are not part of the faith. Furthermore, Maturidi argued that "faith cannot be reduced or increased in essence, although it can be said to be increased by renewal and repetition."
                Maturidi advocated the use of allegorical interpretation in relation to anthropomorphic expressions in the Qur'an, although he rejected many interpretations that mutants would arrive at using this method. In other cases, Maturidi accepted the use of the traditionalist method of reading the scriptures bilā kayf, which insisted on "unconditional acceptance of the published text." 
                Maturidi further rejected the mutated in his defense of the attributes of God "as real and eternally existing." In essence God (ḳā'ima bi 'l-d̲h̲āt).  His main theological disagreement with Ashari was that he claimed that the attributes of essence and action were "equally eternal and enduring in the Divine essence." He therefore "insisted that the expressions 'God is the eternal Creator' and 'God created from eternity (lam yazal k̲h̲āliḳan)' are equally valid, even though the created world is temporary." Moreover, Maturidi firmly defended the beatification vision (ru'ya, literally "God's vision") from the mutilists, but "constantly rejected the possibility of idrāk, which he understood as capturing God with his eyes."
                Contrary to popular belief, Al-Maturidi was not a disciple of Al-Ash'ari. The historian al-Bayadi (died 1078) emphasized this saying: “The Maturidi is not a follower of Ash'ari, as many people believe. Abu Hanifa School and its followers. ”
                As Maturidi grew up, there was a reaction  against some Islamic schools, especially the Mu'tazilites, the Karmats, and the Shiites. Maturidi, along with two other prominent scholars, wrote mainly on the faith in Islam, and the other two are Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari in Iraq and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi in Egypt.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi, was considered to be the most important Central Asian Hanafi theologian in the Maturidite school of Sunni Islam after Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 333 A.H), but he lived in an age in which Muslim theology was reaching its peak, and he contributed to this development.
                    He was born in an educated family. His ancestors were respected by society as great scholars of "fiqh" science. His great-grandfather, Makhul Nasafi, was a disciple of Imam al-Maturidi, and his grandfather, Mu'tamid ibn Makhul Nasafi, was famous as a theologian, Hanafi jurist (Faqih), and mystic (Sufi) who was reported to have written a number of works. He received his primary education from his father and grandfather.
                    He was born in Nasaf (present Karshi) around 438 A.H. (1046 A.D.) and died in the same city in 508 A.H. (1115 A.D.). It was said that his birth was in 418 A.H. (1027 A.D.) according to Khair al-Din al-Zarkali and Umar Rizo Kahhol, while Qutluwbugha says it was in 438 A.H. (1046 A.D.), based on the age of his death being seventy years in the year of 508 A.H. (1115 A.D.).
                    He wrote many works aimed at clarifying misconceptions about Islam, fighting religious fanaticism. Some of his popular and widely accepted works are as follows:
                    Tabsirat al-Adillah (Instructing the Evidences); is considered as the second major work in the Maturidi curriculum, after Imam al-Maturidi's Kitab al-Tawhid.
                    Al-Tamhid li-Qawa'id al-Tawhid (Introduction to the Principles of Monotheism); is a summary of Tabsirat al-Adilla (Instructing the Evidences).
                    Bahr al-Kalam fi 'Ilm al-Tawhid (Ocean of Discussions on the Science of Monotheism); is one of the main sources of "kalam" science in Maturidism.

                <h2 style="color: #EB5E28;">Al Ghazali</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Al Ghazali, his full name was Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Tusiyy al-Gazzally. A total of about 70 works can be attributed to Al-Ghazali.
                    He is also known to have written a fatwa against the Taifa kings of Al Andalus, declaring them to be unprincipled, not fit to rule and that they should be removed from power. This fatwa was used by Yusuf ibn Tashfin to justify his conquest of al-Andalus.
                    We will dicuss few of his works here. Firstly, we will talk about the Autobiography he wrote, in it al-Ghazali recounts how, when the crisis of epistemological skepticism was resolved "by the light that the Supreme God cast into my bosom .. the key to the greatest knowledge". He studied and mastered Kalam's arguments, Islamic Philosophy and Ismailism. Although he appreciated what was valid in the first two of them, at least he found all three approaches inadequate and found superior value only in the mystical experience and perception (state of prophecy or nubuwwa) he gained as a result of observing Sufi practices. William James, in Varieties of Religious Experience, considers the autobiography an important document for “purely literary students who would like to learn about the insides of non-Christian religions” due to a lack of personal religious denominations and autobiographical literature from this period, outside the Christian tradition.
                    Secondly, we will talk about The Revival of Religious Sciences,  It covers almost all fields of Islamic sciences: fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), kalam (theology) and sufism. It contains four main sections: worship (Rub 'al-'badat), Rules of daily life (Rub' al-'adatat), Paths to Loss (Rub 'al-muhlikat) and Paths to Salvation (Rub'). al-munjiyat). Ihya became the most widely read Islamic text after the Qur’an and hadith. His greatest achievement was the merging of Sunni Orthodox theology and Sufi mysticism into a useful and comprehensive guide to all aspects of Muslim life and death. The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as Nawawi, who said that "if all the books of Islam are lost except Ihya", it would be enough to replace them all ".

                <h2 style="color: #EB5E28;">Ibn Rushd</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Ibn Rushd (14 april 1126 - 11 december 1198). He is the author of over 100 books and treatises, his philosophical works include numerous commentaries on Aristotle, which is why he was known in the Western world as a commentator and the father of rationalism. Ibn Rushd also served as a senior judge and forensic physician for the Caliphate of Almohad.
                    Averroes was a prolific writer and his work, according to Fakhry, “covered a wider range of topics” than any of his eastern predecessors, including philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence, or legal and linguistic theory.
                    Most of his writings were commentaries or paraphrases of Aristotle's works, which, especially long ones, often contained his original thoughts. According to French author Ernest Renan, Averroes wrote at least 67 original works, including 28 on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology and 4 on grammar, in addition to his comments on most works. and his commentary on Plato's Republic. Many of Averroes' works in Arabic have not survived, but so have his translations into Hebrew or Latin. For example, of his long commentaries on Aristotle, only "a small handful of Arabic manuscripts" remain.
                    Academic sources, such as the Fakhry and the Encyclopedia of Islam, cite three articles as major Averroes writings in this area. Fasl al-Maqal (the "decisive agreement") is a treatise from 1178 that defends the compatibility of Islam with philosophy.
                    Al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adillah ("Exposition of Methods of Evidence"), written in 1179, criticizes murderous theologies and sets out Averroes' argument to prove the existence of God. as your thoughts on God's attributes and deeds. Tahafut al-Tahafut of 1180 ("Inconsistency of Inconsistency") is a rejection of al-Ghazali's historical critique of the philosophy of inconsistency of philosophers. He combines ideas in his commentaries and his independent works and uses them to respond to al-Ghazali. The paper also criticizes Avicenna and his Neoplatonic tendencies, sometimes coinciding with al-Ghazali's critiques of him.
