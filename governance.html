                        After the death of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in 632 CE, the fate of the great Islamic
                        Empire  was passed onto his companions who became his immediate successors.
                        Their exemplary stature and unparalled leadership qualities contributed to the massive expansion  
                        of Islam and within 100 years of its origin,
                        its roots stretched from the Arabian Peninsula all the way to Spain
                        in the West, and Northern India in the East.Some of the prominent leaders who exercised policies of great governance
                        during this timeline will be discussed below.

<h2 style="color: #CCC5B9">Hazrat Umar</h2>
</div>

<p style= "color:#CCC5B9">During his reign, Hazrat Umar focused on bringing reforms in the administration and 
closely monitored the implementation of his public policy, especially for the newly conquered lands. A very prominent reform
in this regard has been the setting of a special department to investigate complaints recieved against the officers of the state.
Legal proceedings were in many cases, led personally by Umar(R.A) and his trusted deputy, Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, and any officers 
found guilty of charges recieved strict punishments.The military was also organised as a state department and a
scale of salaries was fixed for all, with opportunities for promotion on the basis of merit and length of service.

</p>
<p style= "color:#CCC5B9"> In addition to this, the social policy of Hazrat Umar has recieved applaud and is deemed 
    to be a model for a welfare state even in the modern times, where intense focused was placed on the regulation of wealth from
    the rich to the poor.Concepts such as welfare and pension were introduced as forms of Zakat and taxes collected in 
    the treasury of the government were provided as incomes to the needy and destitue. This ensured that all groups of citizens, especially
    the  weak, such as orphans, elderly, widows etc were attented to by the state.

<p style = "color :#252422">
Hazrat Ali had to face major problems at the time pf his rule, that included a corrupt and incompetent 
administration, unjust distribution of social priveleges and a huge gap between the wealthy and the poor.
Ali(R.A) expelled all those governors from their posts and replaced them with new one's who had virtures of piety and exceptional
conduct. These included names such as Uthman bin Haneef for Syria  and Mousa Al Ashari for Kufa.The rights of Muslims 
were closely observed and protected.Hazrat Ali (as) declared "O people, I have the same rights and 
obligation as the rest of you". Thereafter, every intruder who attempted to expoit his position for personal
gain was cutt off from the government.
</p>
<p style = "color :#252422">
He also brought changes to the fiscal and monetary policies. They were basically targeted at the Quraish 
who unduely expolited their social priveleges and financial statuses.They were granted limited freedom in order
to maintain law and order, and eliminate the menace of bribery.Revenue was collected in the form of gold and silver 
and zakat and sadaqah were regulary distributed amongst the needy.
Imam Ali was the first Islamic ruler to introduce the budget system for collection of revenues and expenditure. Each province had to present its budget directly to him for approval. The income was divided into two heads, provincial and central. Zakat and Sadaqa were items of the 
Central Revenue while, Land Revenue and Jizya were Provincial Revenue.

<p style= "color: #403D39 " >

Harun Al Rashid, whose name literally translates to 'the upright' or 'the Rightly Guided', 
was the fifth Abbasid Caliph. Harun held great admiration for  the ancient Persian king Darius and, to some
 extent, attempted to imitate his rule. It was during his reign that Baghdad flourished like never before, and 
 taxes paid by the local rulers were used to fund architecture, arts and court luxuries.
 Under al-Rashid, each city had its own law enforcement, which apart from keeping order was supposed to examine the public markets in order to ensure, for instance, that proper scales and measures were used; enforce the 
 payment of debts; and clamp down on illegal activities such as gambling, usury, and sales of alcohol
 Envoys traveled between Harun's and Charlemagne's courts, where amicable discussions
  concerning Christian access to the Holy Land and the exchange of gifts, took place frequently.He exercised diplomacy in relations with
 other states and an alliance was established with the Chinese Tang dynasty by
  Ar-Rashid after he sent embassies to China.

<p style = "color:#EB5E28">
Salahuddin began his miltary career as a soldier in an Egyptian campaign and in 1169,
became 
the vizier of Egypt's Fatimid caliphate. His vision was focused towards uniting all the Muslim territories
 in Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt.His governance was driven by the an unwavering devotion
to the idea of jihad or holy war. An essential part of his policy was to encourage the growth and spread of
 religious institutions.
A prominent phase of his governance comes  after his ascension to vizierate in Egypt , 
when he faced resistance 
from pro-Fatimid military and civilian elites. To curb any revolts against his government, he 
restructured the Fatimid military
and increased its effectiveness to gain more control over it. His administration was
 benefitted by the inclusion
of Egyptians elites, who were skilled and qulaified governors. In addition to this, non-
muslims were treated fairly
and had a significant role in the highly successful financial system which 
contributed to a flourishing economy.
